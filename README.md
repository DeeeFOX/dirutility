# Directory Utilities

dirutility is a Python package for generating an inventory of files within a directory tree.



### How it works

Directory Utilities is built using almost entirely builtin Python libraries making it extremely lightweight. The walk
module performs 'inventory' tasks that return information on file and folder contents of a root directory.  The move
module performs 'structure' tasks that reorganize the data structures within a directory based on a variety of
parameters.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Upgrade to the latest version of pip

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Installing

Create a virtual development environment and install the latest version of dirutility from PyPi or github

PyPi distribution

```
pip install dirutility
```

GitHub distribution

```
pip install git+git://github.com/mrstephenneal/dirutility.git
```
or
```
pip install git+https://github.com/mrstephenneal/dirutility.git
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
